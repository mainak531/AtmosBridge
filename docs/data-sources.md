# AtmosBridge — Data Sources & Provenance Registry

Every data element consumed, processed, or surfaced by AtmosBridge is governed by explicit provenance tracking. No environmental figure is presented without its origin classification.

## Data Provenance Taxonomies

1. **`Observed`**: Directly ingested from a real-world, verified live monitoring station or telemetry feed (e.g., OpenAQ real-time sensor network, Open-Meteo live weather observation).
2. **`Inferred`**: Derived by algorithmic fusion or AI multimodal analysis from user submissions and contextual environmental parameters (e.g., Gemini visual plume severity assessment).
3. **`Predicted`**: Forecasted into future time horizons by physics-grounded regression models or dispersion physics (e.g., Physics-Grounded 6h/12h/24h spike probability, atmospheric wind drift cone).
4. **`Simulated`**: Generated deterministically for demonstration, benchmarking, dense sensor clustering, or cross-border regional scenarios (e.g., satellite aerosol optical depth proxy, seeded industrial corridors).

## Live Ingestion & Caching Policy

- External API requests to OpenAQ and Open-Meteo are cached with a **15-minute TTL** using an in-memory cache to prevent rate-limiting and guarantee ultra-fast sub-50ms dashboard responsiveness.
- When an external API is unreachable or rate-limited, the backend automatically transitions to the cached baseline or seeded observation layer without crashing, tagging the payload with `"provenance": "simulated"`.
