## 🌟 Executive Summary

Major cities and border regions across the BRICS nations — India, Brazil, Russia, China, South Africa — miss acute, localized pollution events such as illegal industrial emissions, biomass burning, and trans-boundary smog plumes, because conventional monitoring stations report only sparse, macro-level averages.

**AtmosBridge** closes this gap by fusing:

1. **Multimodal citizen reports** — photos, voice transcripts, geo-tagged text
2. **Ground sensor networks** — OpenAQ live telemetry + a dense simulated mesh
3. **Satellite proxy indicators** — Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) proxies
4. **Meteorological dispersion feeds** — Open-Meteo live wind and humidity data

**Google Gemini** performs multimodal reasoning to structure citizen sightings into actionable incident data rather than inventing readings. A **physics-grounded atmospheric risk predictor** (ventilation, boundary-layer inversion, and stagnation modeling) forecasts 6h/12h/24h spike risk. Together they surface hyperlocal hotspots, model cross-border atmospheric drift, and route actionable alerts to municipal authorities — with human-in-the-loop governance and zero automated punitive action.

> **In plain terms:** city-wide AQI averages hide the pollution events that actually hurt people — a field burning three streets away, a factory discharging at night, smog drifting in from across a border. AtmosBridge fuses what citizens report, what sensors and satellites pick up, and what weather patterns suggest, and lets Gemini make sense of it together. Instead of a dashboard full of disconnected numbers, it surfaces where pollution is concentrated, where it's likely headed, and what needs attention — while a human authority always makes the final call.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite — **pure JavaScript/JSX, no TypeScript** — Tailwind CSS, Recharts |
| Maps | Leaflet + OpenStreetMap & CARTO Dark Matter cartographic tiles |
| Backend | Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, Uvicorn |
| AI / Multimodal | Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash` / `gemini-2.0-flash` / `gemini-1.5-flash`), with a deterministic demo-mode fallback |
| Prediction | Physics-grounded atmospheric risk predictor (ventilation, boundary-layer inversion, stagnation modeling) |
| Live data | OpenAQ (air quality), Open-Meteo (weather) |
| Simulated data | Seeded dense sensor mesh + satellite aerosol proxy dataset, clearly labeled in-app |
| Deployment | Vercel (frontend SPA + Python serverless API via `api/index.py`) / Google Cloud Run (containerized backend, `Dockerfile` included) |

Full design rationale lives in [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) and [`docs/design.md`](./docs/design.md).

> **Note:** `scripts/train_model.py` also exports an XGBoost regressor to `backend/models/spike_predictor.json` as an exploratory/benchmark artifact. The live prediction endpoint currently serves the physics-grounded model described above, not this trained file — see [Known Limitations](#️-known-limitations--truthfulness).

---

## 🛠️ Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Seed synthetic/historical datasets
python ../scripts/seed_data.py

# Optional: train the exploratory XGBoost model (not used by the live API — see note above)
# Requires extra packages not in requirements.txt:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost
python ../scripts/train_model.py

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Swagger docs live at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173`.

### One-command build (root)
```bash
npm run build   # runs frontend install + build, per root package.json
```

### Try it live
No local setup needed — the deployed prototype is at **[atmosbridgeai.vercel.app](https://atmosbridgeai.vercel.app/)**.

## 📦 Environment Variables

Copy the safe template before running anything:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Side | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes, for live AI features | Server-only | Google AI Studio key — never sent to the browser |
| `OPENAQ_API_KEY` | No | Server-only | OpenAQ v2 API key (optional) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | No | Server-only | Allowed CORS origins for production |
| `PORT` / `HOST` / `ENVIRONMENT` | No | Server-only | Local dev server config |

```ini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0
ENVIRONMENT=development
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://atmosbridgeai.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173
```

If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unset, the backend serves deterministic **demo-mode** responses so the app remains fully demoable offline.

---

## 🔐 Security

- **Secrets via environment variables only.** All API keys are supplied through `.env`, never hardcoded.
- **Git exclusion.** `.env` and all credential files (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `service-account*.json`) are excluded via `.gitignore` and must never be committed.
- **Server-side isolation.** Backend keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, etc.) are used exclusively by FastAPI and never reach the React bundle.
- **Pre-commit protection.** A pre-commit hook scans staged files for accidental credential patterns; run `python scripts/security_check.py` any time to audit the working tree.

> [!WARNING]
> Never paste real API keys into `.env.example`, this README, source code, or any tracked file.

## 🛡️ Responsible AI & Data Provenance

Every numeric environmental figure in AtmosBridge carries an explicit provenance tag:

- **`Observed`** — directly ingested from live stations (OpenAQ, Open-Meteo)
- **`Inferred`** — structured by Gemini multimodal analysis from citizen submissions
- **`Predicted`** — forecast by the physics-grounded regression model
- **`Simulated`** — seeded synthetic sensor grids and cross-border scenarios, clearly labeled

Human-in-the-loop oversight is mandatory: authorities review and manually acknowledge every alert before any action is taken. No automated regulatory enforcement occurs, and the platform never issues a medical diagnosis — only general public-health guidance. See [`docs/prd.md`](./docs/prd.md) §13 and [`docs/responsible-ai.md`](./docs/responsible-ai.md) for the full Responsible AI statement.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Truthfulness

- Satellite data is a seeded proxy, not a live Earth Engine feed (documented ingestion path for a production swap is in [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md)).
- Sensor grid density is simulated to be realistic, not sourced from a live third-party network.
- Cross-border pollution intelligence uses one seeded demo scenario rather than live inter-country data sharing.
- Authority roles are demo-based and not tied to real municipal identity systems.
- `scripts/train_model.py` exports an XGBoost model that is **not currently loaded by the live `/api/predict` endpoint** — the API serves the physics-grounded predictor instead. Treat the trained model as an exploratory artifact until it's wired in.
- Running `scripts/train_model.py` requires `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `xgboost`, which are **not listed in `requirements.txt`** — install them separately (see Quickstart).
